meter
=====

Meter - is a simple micro-benchmarking tool for Android (not only for Android, its actually for Java). 
It was designed for Android. Meter try to make measurement aNn easy task, with minimal impact on total project performance.

Design objectives
===================

* minimalistic code
* deployment in one file
* no support of scenarious that has more than 256 steps
* measurment of loops:
** loops with known number of iterations
** loops with unknown number of iterations
**  loop min/max/average cost of iteration
* measurement limiteed by one thread (partly limited)
*
